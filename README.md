# Intern Project - SuperDAO

## SuperDao

## Description

This was a project that was created while on an internship programme at blockchain services company Labrys. The brief was to build a full stack application using React for the front-end and NodeJS, MongoDB & Express for the backend and also integrate a Solidity contract too.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
